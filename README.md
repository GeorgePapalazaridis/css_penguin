# css_penguin

I designed an animated penguin with css

My goal here is to practice with css animation properties like `transform` and use `@keyframes` to understand this concept.

Generally, the `@keyframes` rule in CSS is used to define animations. Allows you to specify a set of styles that an element should have at various points during an animation sequence..

# How to display the css penguin

1. Download index.html and styles.css files.
2. Right-click on the index.html file and open it with your browser.
3. Click on the penguin for a smooth zoom-in view.

# What the screen looks like
